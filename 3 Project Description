🧑‍🎓 1. Student Database Management System
🔹 Project Description:

The Student Database Management System is a Java console-based application that helps manage student records. 
Using OOP concepts, you’ll create classes like Student, DatabaseConnection, and StudentDAO. 
The system connects to a MySQL database using JDBC to perform operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student details.

org/example/
│
├── DatabaseConnection.java   → handles MySQL connection
├── Student.java              → data model (POJO)
├── StudentDAO.java           → DAO interface
├── StudentDAOImpl.java       → DAO implementation (CRUD)
└── MainApp.java              → user interface / main program


🎯 Objectives:

To store and manage student information efficiently.

To learn how to connect Java with MySQL using JDBC.

To practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

Java (Core + OOP)

MySQL Database

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

📋 Features:

Add New Student – Enter student details like name, roll number, course, and marks.

View All Students – Display a list of all students from the database.

Search Student by ID/Roll Number – Find a specific student’s details.

Update Student Information – Modify existing student details.

Delete Student Record – Remove a student from the database.

Exit Program – End the application safely.

🧩 Example Classes:

Student → represents a student (data model).

DatabaseConnection → handles MySQL connection.

StudentDAO → performs CRUD operations.

MainApp → main menu and user interface.

💰 2. Monthly Expense Manager
🔹 Project Description:

The Monthly Expense Manager is a console-based app that helps users track their income and expenses. The user can add daily expenses, categorize them, and view total monthly spending. Data is stored in a MySQL database, and JDBC is used to handle all data operations.

🎯 Objectives:

To learn how to store and manage financial data.

To understand OOP principles by designing separate classes for expenses and categories.

To perform calculations (total expenses, savings, etc.) using Java.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

Java (OOP, basic calculations)

MySQL

JDBC

📋 Features:

Add Expense – Add details like date, category, amount, and description.

View All Expenses – Show all recorded expenses from the database.

View Total Monthly Expense – Calculate the total spending for a given month.

Search Expense by Category or Date – Filter records.

Delete an Expense – Remove an unwanted record.

Exit Program – Close the program.

🧩 Example Classes:

Expense → represents an expense record.

DatabaseConnection → manages database connectivity.

ExpenseDAO → contains methods to add/view/update/delete expenses.

ExpenseManagerApp → contains the main logic and user menu.

📚 3. Library Management System
🔹 Project Description:

The Library Management System is a Java console program that manages books and members in a library. It allows adding new books, issuing books to members, returning them, and checking availability. All data is stored in MySQL, and operations are handled through JDBC.

🎯 Objectives:

To understand object relationships (Book–Member–Library).

To learn how to manage multiple entities in a database.

To practice real-world CRUD operations with relational data.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

Java (OOP)

MySQL

JDBC

📋 Features:

Add New Book – Add books with title, author, and quantity.

View All Books – Display available books.

Register Member – Add new library members.

Issue Book – Assign a book to a member (reduce book count).

Return Book – Return a book (increase book count).

Delete Book or Member – Remove entries.

Exit Program

🧩 Example Classes:

Book → represents a book record.

Member → represents a library member.

LibraryDAO → handles all database operations (books and members).

DatabaseConnection → manages JDBC connection.

LibraryApp → provides a console-based menu.
